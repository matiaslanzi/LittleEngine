# LittleEngine
Simple SDL game engine

Messy for now, I am working on cleaning it to continue development. 
In the mean time I wrote a [mini version of the engine MicroEngine](https://github.com/matiaslanzi/MicroEngine) to be able to quickly prototype or visualize.

Oh and there is no make file, I use to compile this with a bash script, duh! so I'm getting into make now where I should be getting acquainted with Cmake. But I really want to have the make basics down.

## Contributions
Please feel free to contribute to this project. I marked with TODO: the stuff that can be made better and of course any ideas are welcome.

Hope this is as useful for you as it was for me writing it. I claim no status in these programming matters other than longevity. I am just having fun. I love C++ and my only hope is to continue learning. 

Thank you.
